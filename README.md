You can use notebook with any installation by using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jopperking/Cifar10_Classification/blob/master/Cifar10.ipynb).
In fact, every page of this documentation is also available as an interactive notebook - click "Open in colab" at the top of any page to open it (be sure to change the Colab runtime to "GPU" to have it run fast!)
